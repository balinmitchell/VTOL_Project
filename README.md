# VTOL_Project

After completing MECHENG 712 Aerohydrodynamics in my last year of University and competing in a glider competiion as part of an assignment I got hooked on flight and aerial vehicles. After some time learning about remote control (RC) aerial vehicles the concept of building a Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft is something I would like to do. However, considering the complexity of such a project I have broken this down into managaeble stages. With zero background in RC aerial vehicles I will be starting from the very bottom. I have included flight controllers as a large aspect of this project as I am also interested in learning more about control system hardware and code. 

## Project Timeline
The following timeline roughly outlines the project stages. This will be updated as the project unfolds.

* Fixed Wing Build
* Fixed Wing FC Build
* Quadcopter Build
* Quadcopter FC Implementation
* Tricopter Build and FC Implementation
* VTOL Build and FC Implementation
